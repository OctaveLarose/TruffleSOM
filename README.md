TruffleSOM - The Simple Object Machine Smalltalk implemented using Oracle's Truffle Framework
=============================================================================================

Introduction
------------

This is the repository for TruffleSOM, an implementation of the Simple Object
Machine (SOM). SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect that was used to teach VM
construction at the [Hasso Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at
the University of Ã…rhus (Denmark) where it was used for teaching and as the
foundation for [Resilient Smalltalk][RS].

In addition to TruffleSOM, other implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM),
C++ (SOM++), and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

TruffleSOM is a [Truffle][T]-based implementation of SOM, including SOM's
standard library and a number of examples. Please see the [main project
page][SOM] for links to other VM implementations.

Obtaining and Running TruffleSOM
--------------------------------

To checkout the code:

    git clone https://github.com/SOM-st/TruffleSOM.git

Then, TruffleSOM can be build with Ant:

    ant jar

Afterwards, the tests can be executed with:

    ./som -G -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    ./som -G -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello.som

When working on TruffleSOM using Eclipse, ant can generate the Eclipse projects
for the Truffle framework and the Graal compiler:

    ant ideinit

For other IDEs, the mx tool in `libs/mx` can generate configurations.
The following will for instance generate the IntelliJ projects for
the Truffle framework:

    cd libs/truffle/truffle
    ../../mx/mx intellijinit

TruffleSOM uses the Graal compiler to reach state-of-the-art performance.
To use it, we need to compile it together with TruffleSOM:

    ant compile

Afterwards, we can run a benchmark, and observe that the initial iterations
take much longer, but after a while we reach magnitudes faster execution speeds:

    ./som -cp Smalltalk Examples/Benchmarks/BenchmarkHarness.som Mandelbrot 100 500
